                                 JAPS_CHECKIN


This package contains Mumie documents and pseudo-documents the platform needs
to operate.


1. Setting the checkin root
   ========================

The files in 'checkin' and descendant folders should be added to the global
checkin tree (a directory tree on your local computer which mirrors the
contents of the Mumie server). This is called "mounting" the files to the
checkin tree. The root of the checkin tree defaults to $HOME/mumie/checkin,
where $HOME is your home directory. If you want to change this, you have two
options:

  1.1. Set the environment variable MM_CHECKIN_ROOT, and give it the value
       <my-checkin-root>, where the latter is the checkin root directory.
       This option has the advantage that MM_CHECKIN_ROOT is recognized by
       other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  1.2  Change to the root directory of this package (the directory this file is
       in), create a file named build.conf and add  the following line to it: 

         checkin_root=<my-checkin-root>

       Remark: The "mounting" of the chekin files is done by a Bash script
       which reads the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus,
       you can use shell substitution in build.conf, e.g.,

         checkin_root=$HOME/foo/checkin

If <checkin-root> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_CHECKIN_ROOT, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


2. Mounting the files to the checkin tree
   ======================================

Type

  $ ./build.sh mount-checkin

at the shell prompt.

Remark: build.sh is the build script of thisn package. To get more information
about it, type

  $ ./build.sh -h
