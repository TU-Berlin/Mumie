                       MMJVMD INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


1.Requirements
  ============

  1.1. Java 6 JDK

  1.2. Mmjutil - this is another Mumie Software Package

  1.3. Mmjipc - this is still another Mumie Software Package

  1.4. Ant 1.6.2. Other (but not too old) versions probably work, too.


2. Installation location
   =====================

All files are installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to
/usr/local. If you want to change the default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Japs Client distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. Build and Installation
   ======================

  3.1. Change to the root directory of the Mmjvmd distribution (the
       directory this file is in).   

  3.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds Mmjvmd. 

  3.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  3.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs Mmjvmd.

Remark: build.sh is Mmjvmd's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


4. Post-installation setup
   =======================

The executables mmjvmd and mmjvmc are installed in <prefix>/bin. Make sure this
is in your PATH environment variable if you want to be able to start the
executables without specifying the path.
