This README file explains how to install and use the MUMIE activity module.
Be sure to use Moodle 1.9 or higher. Ohterwise the module will not work properly.

How to install:
1. Copy the 'mumiemodule' folder into Moodle's subdirectory 'mod'
   Be sure that the subdirectory 'logs' has write-permission to anybody.
2. Login into Moodle as an admin and click on 'Notifications' in the Site Administration
   Now you can select 'MUMIE-activity' as an activity in the course view. 


How to use:
1. Be sure to have the course and its participants done.
   Be careful: MUMIE does its mapping from users to classes via tutorials.
   Therefore the course in Moodle has to have groups with the participants.
   It is recommended to select 'separate' for the group settings.
   Each course participant (i. e. student) has to take part in exactly one group.
   Tutors can teach more than one group. If there is no tutor for a group,
   then MUMIE will take a dummy-tutor. 
   But it is just allowed to have exactly one tutor per group.

2. Turn editing on.
3. Select 'MUMIE-activity' from the 'Add an activity...' dropdown menu.
4. Enter a name and a description and select a MUMIE-course to link with.
5. Submit.
