                   MATHLET FACTORY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



1.Requirements
  ============

  1.1. Java JDK 1.4.2_10 or better

  1.2. Java3d

  1.3. Ant 1.6.2. Other (but not too old) versions probably work, too.


2. Installation location
   =====================

The Java libraries and the documentation files are all installed under a
directory <prefix> which defaults to /usr/local. If you want to change the
default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Mathlet Factory distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. Checkin file location
   =====================

The master and content files of the Mathlet Factory are placed in

  <checkin-root>/system/libraries

where <checkin-root> is the root directory of the global checkin tree. It
defaults to $HOME/mumie/checkin, where $HOME is your home directory. If you
want to change this, you have two options, similar as with the installation
location:

  3.1. Set the environment variable MM_CHECKIN_ROOT, and give it the value
       <my-checkin-root>, where the latter is the directory where you want the
       checkin files to be placed. This option has the advantage that
       MM_CHECKIN_ROOT is recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE
       project, too.

  3.2. Add the following line to the file build.conf (cf. 2.2.):

         checkin_root=<my-checkin-root>

If <checkin-root> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_CHECKIN_ROOTq, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


4. Build and Installation
   ======================

  4.1. Change to the root directory of the Mathlet Factory distribution (the
       directory this file is in).   

  4.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds the Mathlet Factory. 

  4.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  4.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs the Mathlet Factory.

Remark: build.sh is Mathlet Factory's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


5. Checkin files
   =============

To add the master and content files of the Mathlet Factory to the global checkin
tree, type

 $ ./build.sh mount-checkin

This will create two softlinks in <checkin-root>/system/libraries,

  jar_mathlet_factory.meta.xml  and  jar_mathlet_factory.content.jar,

which point to

  <base>/checkin/system/util/jar_mathlet_factory.meta.xml

and

  <base>/checkin/system/util/jar_mathlet_factory.content.jar,

respectively. The latter is again a softlink to

  ../../../lib/java/mumie-japs-client-for-applets.jar.
