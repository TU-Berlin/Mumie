                                   MMDAEMON



Provides the 'mmdaemon' program which starts an arbitrary command as a
daemon process. That means the process runs in the background and has no
control terminal. mmdaemon retuns immediately after the daemon process has been
started.

The synopsis of mmdaemon is:

  mmdaemon [OPTIONS] COMMAND [PARAMS]

COMMAND and PARAMS are the command to start and a list of parameters to pass to
it, respectively. OPTIONS is a list of options passed to the mmdaemon command
itself. The possibly options are:

  --dir=DIR, -d DIR

      Sets the working directory of the daemon. Defaults to the current working
      directory.

  --stdin=IN_FILE, -i IN_FILE

      Specifies a file where the standard input of the daemon is read
      from. Defaults to "/dev/null", i.e., the daemon gets no input.

  --stdout=OUT_FILE, -o OUT_FILE

      Specifies a file where the standard output of the daemon is redirected
      to. Defaults to "/dev/null", i.e., the standard output is discarded.

  --stderr=ERR_FILE, -e ERR_FILE

      Specifies a file where the standard error stream of the daemon is
      redirected to. Defaults to "/dev/null", i.e., the standard error stream
      is discarded. 

In additianal, mmdaemon recognizes the following options for displaying help
and version informations instead of lauching a daemon process:

  --help, -h

      Prints a help text to stdout and exits

  --version, -v

      Prints version information to stdout and exits

If one of these options are set, COMMAND and PARAMS must not be specified.
