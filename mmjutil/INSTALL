                       MMJUTIL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



1. Requirements
   ============

  1.1. Java 1.4.2_10 or better.


2. Installation location
   =====================

Mmjutil will be installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to
/usr/local. If you want to change this, proceed as follows: Change to the root
directory of the Mmjutil distribution (this is the directory this file is in),
create a file named build.conf and add the following line to it:

  prefix=<my-prefix>

where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want Mmjutil to be installed.

Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads the
file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use shell
substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

  prefix=$HOME

would set the installation location to your home directory.

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give
it the value <my-prefix>. This has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. Build and Installation
   ======================

  3.1. Change to the root directory of the Mmjutil distribution (this is the
       directory this file is in).  

  3.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds Mmjutil. 

  3.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  3.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs Mmjutil.

Remark: build.sh is Mmjutil's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


4. Post-installation setup
   =======================

If you want to use Mmjutil, make sure <prefix>/lib/java/mumie-util.jar is in
your classpath.
