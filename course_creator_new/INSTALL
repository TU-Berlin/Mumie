                        COURSE CREATOR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


1.Requirements
  ============

  1.1. Java 6 JDK with Xalan updated to version 2.7.0 or better.

  1.2. Japs Client (another Mumie software package)


2. Installation location
   =====================

All files are installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to
/usr/local. If you want to change the default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Course Creator distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


5. Build and Installation
   ======================

  5.1. Change to the root directory of the Course Creator distribution (the
       directory this file is in).   

  5.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh all

       This builds Course Creator. 

  5.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  5.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs Course Creator.

  5.6. To install the other required parts, type

         $ ./build.sh install-third-party-java

       This installs some Jars.

Remark: build.sh is Course Creator's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


6. Post-installation setup
   =======================

The executables are installed in <prefix>/bin. Make sure this is in yuor PATH
environment variable if you want to be able to start the executables without
specifying the path.
