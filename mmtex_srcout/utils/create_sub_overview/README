Please use in this way:

1) cd to the root of mmtex
cd ..
cd ..

2) use find to run the script for every file in the dir

find -name '*.p[ml]' -exec perl utils/create_sub_overview/sub_crush.pl '{}' ';' 

This will create two files named 

sub_navi.html
sub_content.html

Then run 

perl utils/create_sub_overview/concat.pl

This will concat the files into one named ready.html and delete the old ones

Have fun....
