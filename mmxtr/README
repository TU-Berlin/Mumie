                                     MMXTR



1. Introduction
   ============

Mmxtr provides two command line tools: mmxtr and mmckxsl. The former performs
XSL transformations, the latter checks XSL files for correct XSL. The
executables mmxtr and mmckxsl are Bash scripts which start certain Java
classes.


2. Usage
   =====

The typical usage of mmxtr is

  $ mmxtr -s XSLFILE -o OUTPUT SOURCE

This applies the stylesheet XSLFILE to the file SOURCE and writes the result to
the file OUTPUT. For more information on mmxtr, type

  $ mmxtr -h

This prints a short help text to stdout.

The typical usage of mmckxsl is

  $ mmckxsl XSLFILE

This checks XSLFILE for correct XSL. If no error is found, the command simly
returns. Otherwise, the errors are reported to stderr. For more information on
mmckxsl, type

  $ mmckxsl -h

This prints a short help text to stdout.


3. Installation
   ============

See the file INSTALL for installation instuctions.


4. Backgrounds
   ===========

The Java class behind mmxtr uses a javax.xml.transform.Transformer object to
carry out the transformation. This object is created by an instance of the
platform default implementation of javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.

The Java class behind mmckxsl checks XSL files by trying to create
javax.xml.transform.Transformer objects from them. These objects are obtained
by an instance of the platform default implementation of
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.
