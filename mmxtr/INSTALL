                        MMXTR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



1.Requirements
  ============

  1.1. Java 1.4.2_10 SDK or better.

  1.2. Ant 1.6.2. Other (but not too old) versions probably work, too.

  1.3. Mmjutil (another Mumie software package)


2. Installation location
   =====================

Mmxtr is installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to /usr/local. If
you want to change the default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Mmxtr distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. Build and Installation
   ======================

  3.1. Change to the root directory of the Mmxtr distribution (the
       directory this file is in).   

  3.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds Mmxtr. 

  3.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  3.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs Mmxtr.

Remark: build.sh is Mmxtr's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


4. Post-installation setup
   =======================

If you want to use Mmxtr, make sure

  <prefix>/bin

is in your classpath. This directory contains the executables.
