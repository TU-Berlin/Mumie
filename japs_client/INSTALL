                     JAPS CLIENT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



1.Requirements
  ============

  1.1. Java 6 SDK. If you can do without console support, Java (1.)4 or (1.)5
       will work, too. See Appendix A.1 for details.

  1.2. jCookie 0.8c. See http://jcookie.sourceforge.net. For your convenience,
       a copy of the jCookie library is included in this distribution. Use
       the "install-jcookie" target of the build script to install it (s.b.).

  1.3. Ant 1.6.2. Other (but not too old) versions probably work, too.


2. Installation location
   =====================

All files are installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to /usr/local. If you want
to change the default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Japs Client distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. Checkin file location
   =====================

The master and content files of the Japs client are placed in

  <checkin-root>/system/libraries

where <checkin-root> is the root directory of the global checkin tree. It
defaults to $HOME/mumie/checkin, where $HOME is your home directory. If you
want to change this, you have two options, similar as with the installation
location:

  3.1. Set the environment variable MM_CHECKIN_ROOT, and give it the value
       <my-checkin-root>, where the latter is the directory where you want the
       checkin files to be placed. This option has the advantage that
       MM_CHECKIN_ROOT is recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE
       project, too.

  3.2. Add the following line to the file build.conf (cf. 2.2.):

         checkin_root=<my-checkin-root>

If <checkin-root> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_CHECKIN_ROOTq, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


4. Keys for jar signing
   ====================

During the build, some of the jars are signed. To this end, a key pair must
exist in the Java keystore. If you do not have a key pair yet, create one with
Java's 'keytool' program. The build process must know the corresponding alias
and password. To achieve this, add the following lines to your build.conf file
(cf. 2.2.):

  signjar_alias=<alias>
  signjar_storepass=<password>

<alias> is the alias of the key pair. <password> is the password of the
keystore. - PLEASE NOTE: The key pair can have a separate password distinct
from that of the keystore; but currently the build assumes that this option is
not used.


5. Build and installation
   ======================

  5.1. Change to the root directory of the Japs Client distribution (the
       directory this file is in).   

  5.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds the Japs Client. 

  5.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  5.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs Japs Client.

  5.6. If you want to install jCookie, type

         $ ./build.sh install-jcookie

       This installs jCookie.

Remark: build.sh is Japs Client's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


6. Checkin files
   =============

To add the master and content files of the Japs client to the global checkin
tree, type

 $ ./build.sh mount-checkin

This will create two softlinks in <checkin-root>/system/libraries,

  jar_japs_client.meta.xml  and  jar_japs_client.content.jar,

which point to

  <base>/checkin/system/libraries/jar_japs_client.meta.xml

and

  <base>/checkin/system/libraries/jar_japs_client.content.jar,

respectively. The latter is again a softlink to

  ../../../lib/java/mumie-japs-client-for-applets.jar.


7. Post-installation setup
   =======================

If you want to use the Japs client, make sure

  <prefix>/lib/java/mumie-japs-client.jar

is in your classpath.


A.1. Building Japs Client with Java 1.4 or 1.5
     =========================================

You can build the Japs Client package with Java 1.4 or 1.5, but you must
exclude some classes from the build. These classes depend on the new Console
class in Java 6. They provide console support (reading user name and password
from the console); thus, you have no console support if you build with Java 1.4
or 1.5. Usually, this is no problem, since console support is not used in the
current Mumie version.

To exclude the necessare classes from the build, add the following line to your
build.conf file (cf. section 2.2):

  with_console=false

Then build normally, but please note: If you have done a build with a higher Java
version before, set the -f or --force flag. Otherwise, classes from the earlier
build may not be recompiled.
