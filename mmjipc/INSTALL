                       MMJIPC INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



1. Requirements
   ============

  1.1. Java 1.4.2_10 or better.


2. Installation location
   =====================

All files are installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to
/usr/local. If you want to change the default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Japs Client distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. 64 bit note
   ===========

If you are building on a 64 bit machine, it might be necessary to call gcc
with the -fPIC option. To do so, add the following line to your build.conf file
(cf. 2.2):

  gcc_options=-fPIC


4. Build and Installation
   ======================

  4.1. Change to the root directory of the Mmjipc distribution (this is the
       directory this file is in).  

  4.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds Mmjipc. 

  4.3. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  4.4. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs Mmjipc.

Remark: build.sh is Mmjipc's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


5. Post-installation setup
   =======================

If you want to use Mmjipc, make sure <prefix>/lib/java/mumie-ipc.jar is in
your classpath.
