\section{Tests for nesting markups..}
\subsection{The source code}

\subsection{The result}

\emph{Now, lets try some multiline text, first with a \% at the end, to see if this is %
  working. Then we will go to the next line, without qouting the not visible newline tag, to
  confuse the scanner a little bit..
  Okay, this is working without any problems. But what will happen, if some nested ohter
  highlighting commands are used in this multiline text.. \keyb{This will highlight like a
    keyboard entered text, also containing a linebrake after "like a"}..
Now some really deep nesting, \quoted{ \keyb{This is keyb \plhld{plus placeholder which
      is quoted and \var{where a variable might be found}}}}
  }

Last but not least, there is still the task to describe what highlighting enviroment allows
nesting, quoted text for example, is not allowed somewhere.. (but where )

\plhld{ test \quoted{qouted} }
\keyb{ test \quoted{qouted} }
\emph{ test \quoted{qouted} }

\emph{ \keyb{ test \quoted{qouted} } }
\emph{ \keyb{ test \plhld{ test \quoted{qouted} } } }

\var{ \keyb{ test \plhld{ test \quoted{qouted} } } }

\emph{ \keyb{ test \var{ test \quoted{qouted} } } }

There seems to be no limit, perhaps the error I got a few lines earlier where just a typo,
I'm unable to reproduce it at the moment.. Perhaps we will give it a try sometimes later..
