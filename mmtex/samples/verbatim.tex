\subsection{Source Code}
\verb"
\verbatim
Enter anything you like (see below)....
\endverbatim"


\subsection{Result}

\verbatim

Enter anything you like in this area, it will not be interpreted...
Just the ampersand (&) and other special xml chars will be replaced 
by their unicode reference..

Line brakes are kept in the long form, the short form swallows them.

Now some wild special character testing:
!@#$%^&*()_+
12345667890-
:;<.>,.,./?'''

\endverbatim
