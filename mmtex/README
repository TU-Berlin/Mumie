Mmtex is a tool to convert (generalized) LaTeX to XML, with a special focus on
mathematical texts. The XML produced by Mmtex is intended to be transformed
further to XHTML/MathML or other formats. This distribution contains
XSL-Stylesheets for the transformation to XHTML/MathML. The transformation to
other formats is not implemented yet.

Currently, two different LaTeX dialects are implemented: a standard LaTeX
similar one, and a very specialized one for the contents of the MUMIE
e-learning platform. With both dialects, non-mathematical parts are converted
to a particular XML, whereas mathematical parts are converted to MathML
(presentation markup plus a few extra elements to get a slightly more
semantical description). This distribution contains only the first dialect.

Mmtex is written in Perl. It is highly modular, flexible and customizable. No
LaTeX commands or environments except \documentclass are hardcoded in the core
sources. Commands, environments, and the resulting XML are implemented in
exchangeable Perl libraries, controlled by the document class, which is a Perl
library, too.

Mmtex has been developed in the e-learning project MUMIE (see
www.mumie.net). MUMIE was founded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
and Research and is a cooperation of the Berlin and Munich Universities of
Technology and the Universities of Aachen and Potsdam.

file "LICENSE" for details.
