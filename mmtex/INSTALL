                      MMTEX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



1.Requirements
  ============

  1.1. Perl must be installed on your computer. MmTeX expects the perl
       executable under /user/bin/. We recommend Perl version 5.8.6 or
       better. You can check the version by 

         $ perl -v

  1.2. Mmplutil must be installed on your computer. Mmplutil is another
       software from the MUMIE project. You can get from the MUMIE download
       page. The required version is 1.0 or better.

  1.3. For the conversion of XML to (X)HTML documents, Java must be installed
       on your computer, version 1.4.2_10 or better.

       NOTE for Java 1.4.2_10 users: You should update certain libraries of
       your Java distribution. This is described in appendix A.1.

  1.4. For the conversion of XML to (X)HTML, Xalan-Java must be installed on
       your computer in addition to Java. If you use the Java distribution
       from Sun, Xalan-Java is already included. We did not check if this is
       the case with other Java distributions, too. If Xalan is not included in
       your Java distribution, you can get it from the Apache Jakarta project,

         http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html

  1.5. To view mathematical formulas, your browser must be able to render
       MathML. This is the case for Mozilla and Firefox. We recommend Firefox
       1.5.0 or better.

  1.6  For Mozilla and Firefox to be able to render MathML correctly,
       additional fonts must be installed on your computer. See

         http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts

       for details.


2. Installation location
   =====================

All MmTeX files are installed under a directory <prefix> which defaults to
/usr/local. If you want to change the default, you have two options:

  2.1. Set the environment variable MM_BUILD_PREFIX, and give it the value
       <my-prefix>, where <my-prefix> is the directory where you want the files
       to be installed. This option has the advantage that MM_BUILD_PREFIX is
       recognized by other build scripts of the MUMIE project, too.

  2.2. Change to the root directory of the Mmtex4japs distribution (the
       directory this file is in), create a file named build.conf and add 
       the following line to it: 

         prefix=<my-prefix>

       Remark: The build and installation are done by a Bash script which reads
       the file build.conf by means of the 'source' command. Thus, you can use
       shell substitution in build.conf. E.g.,

         prefix=$HOME

       would set the installation location to your home directory.

If <prefix> is set both in build.conf and by the environment variable
MM_BUILD_PREFIX, the setting in build.conf takes precedence.


3. Build and Installation
   ======================

  3.1. Change to the root directory of the MmTeX distribution (this is the
       directory this file is in).  

  3.2. Type

         $ ./build.sh

       This builds MmTeX. 

  3.4. Make sure you have write permission in <prefix>. Switch user to root if
       necessary.

  3.5. Type

         $ ./build.sh install

       This installs MmTeX.

Remark: build.sh is MmTeX's build script. To get more information about it,
type

  $ ./build.sh -h


4. Post-installation setup
   =======================

The MmTeX executables are installed in <prefix>/bin. Make sure this is in your
PATH variable.



A.1. Updating the Xalan libraries in Java 1.4.2_10
     =============================================

If you use Java 1.4.2_10, you should update certain libraries of that Java
version. You do that by installing Xalan (from the Apache project) and telling
Java to use the respective libraries from Xalan instead of its own. Proceed as
follows: 

  A.1.1. Download xalan-j_2_7_0-bin.tar.gz from

           http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html

  A.1.2. Choose an installation directory for Xalan. This directory is called
         <xalan-prefix> in the following. Create the directory if it does not
         exist already.

  A.1.3. Copy or move the downloaded file to <xalan-prefix>.

  A.1.4. Change into <xalan-prefix>, and extract the downloaded file:

           tar xzf xalan-j_2_7_0-bin.tar.gz

         A subdirectory xalan-j_2_7_0 will be created.

  A.1.5. Change into $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/. $JAVA_HOME is the root of your
         Java installation. Usually, it is set as an environment variable.

  A.1.6. Create a directory "endorsed" if it does not exist already.

  A.1.7. Change into "endorsed".

  A.1.8. Copy the following files from <xalan-prefix> to the current directory,
         or make softlinks:

           xalan.jar,  xercesImpl.jar,  xml-apis.jar, serializer.jar
