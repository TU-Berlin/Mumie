                                    MMCKXML



Provides an executable "mmckxml" which checks XML files for well-formedness
and, optionally, validates them with respect to a DTD or Schema. If no error is
found, mmckxml simply returns with exit code 0. Otherwise, the error is
reported to stderr and the exit code is different from 0.

The executable "mmckxml" is simply a Bash script for starting a Java
application which sends the XML file through a SAX parser.

You can try out mmckxml by applying it to the files in the "test" folder.
